## This is for interview questions

### Q1 Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. 

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Q2 Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list. 

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Q3 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 

### Q4 Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. 

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). 

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

### Q5 Longest Palindromic Substring
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

### Q6 ZigZag Conversion
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows 
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
